# react-weather-app
An app built whilst learning about various types of APIs. This weather app allows you to enter a city and a country and gather weather conditions in that specified lcoation.

This app was built using HTML, CSS ,JavaScript and bootstrap in React and was made to practice the skills I have learnt.

Live version of the app available here (https://johnnyji123.github.io/react-weather-app/).
